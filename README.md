# project-two-instanews-app

A news app that dynamically fetches up to date articles from the Ney York Times API.

Responsively designed using a mobile-first approach and optimized for 3 screen sizes: mobile, min-width: 600px, and min-width: 1000px.

Note:
Currently uses an image on Bill Murray as the background image whenever an article with no image url is found.
